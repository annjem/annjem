        <p>For this Lunar New Year greeting card design, I aimed for a fresh, energetic aesthetic that incorporated traditional festive elements from my home of Taiwan, such as the “dancing lion” decked out in red and gold. I chose Taiwanese foundry Justfont’s <a href="https://justfont.com/burnfont/" target="_blank">Burnfont</a>, an eye-catching heavyweight that demands attention, and set it in an energy-packed bright red to contrast with the golden-yellow background. A traditional pattern rotated at an angle adds even more dynamism to the card, which comes in a red envelope — the traditional way to gift new year’s money.</p>
