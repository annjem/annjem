        <p>For this conceptual fine-dining restaurant’s business card, I aimed for a minimalist, elegant quality. To that end, I limited the palette to dark gray and cream and kept the layout simple.</p>

        <p>As the name suggests, the restaurant serves flavors from around the world. I used the clean lines of a topological map as a minimalist yet visually interesting way to echo that.</p>
