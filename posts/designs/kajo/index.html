        <h2>1. Logo</h2>

        <img src="/assets/images/kajo-logo.svg" id="kajo-logo"/>

        <div>
            <p>I. H. is the owner and founder of her newly-launched independent massage studio Kajo, named after the word for “sunrise” in Finnish. She wanted a logo that evoked light, calmness, and joy. As a trained massage therapist, she also wanted to make sure the branding would communicate that it was a space that focused on health and wellness instead of beauty.</p>

            <p>I started with a few different concepts based around the letter O. Inspired by the gorgeous mural of an ocean on the studio’s walls, I decided to depict the waves of a calming sea.</p>

            <p>To avoid a “beauty salon” impression, I avoided delicate Didonesque serif fonts. Instead, I opted for sans serifs that were modern and professional yet very human. And thanks to the flowing, slightly contrasted strokes in the logo typeface, the waves seamlessly blend into the capital O.</p>

        <h2>2. Business card</h2>

        <p>With the waves in the logo in mind, I chose a painterly background in soothing blues and greens.

        <p>In addition to typical contact information on the front of the card, the client requested a space to write down appointments on the reverse side. This meant a light, low-contrast background for ease of writing, but which remained cohesive with the overall color scheme.</p>

    <section id="gift-card">
        <h2>3. Gift card</h2>

        <p>I incorporated a similar painting-like background as the business card to keep it cohesive. The colors and brushstrokes recall lapping waves, again echoing the logo. I chose a light golden color for the heading text, which stood out well against the blue-green background and made it feel elegant and classy.</p>

        <p>For the area on the front side where the gift value would be written, I made sure to keep the background a lighter color so it would be easy to read. I did the same on the reverse side, where the owner would write down the date of purchase and an optional personal message for the giftee.</p>

        <p>AS Jem was great to work with: she very quickly understood my vision, delivered multiple versions fast, and created designs that feel uniquely me and represent my business wonderfully. Having these lovely designs helps me feel even more confident and proud about my new business, and I still get hyped everytime I see them. Thank you so much for your quality work!</p>
