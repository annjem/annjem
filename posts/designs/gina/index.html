        <p>This conceptual branding project for a Taiwanese teahouse aims to appeal to an older audience seeking a calming space to enjoy tea and company.</p>
        <p>I used vintage illustrations of tea leaves and a kettle, and included hand-drawn floral elements in muted pinks and greens to add interest and a touch of whimsy.</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/gina/font-palette.svg" alt="Two lines of text demonstrating the two fonts used: Jinxuan and Alkes.">
        <p>I set the Mandarin text in the elegant <strong>Jinxuan</strong> and the English not in the corresponding English font, but a serif named <strong>Alkes</strong>. The two fonts have similar thick-to-thin contrasts in their strokes, making them pair together seamlessly.</p>
