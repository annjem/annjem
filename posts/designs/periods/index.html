        <p>For this illustration used by Planned Parenthood Ottawa, my goal was to push back on stigma by presenting menstruation in an friendly, whimsical, yet extremely direct manner. I chose to depict several different products that people who menstruate can choose from, including tampons, cups, and pads.</p>
        
        <p>Advertisements for menstrual products are often shown with a clear, window-cleaner-blue fluid — a complete departure from reality, underlining the stigma against menstruation. With that in mind, I intentionally used a bright red color throughout (with more muted yellows and blues as a contrast).</p>
