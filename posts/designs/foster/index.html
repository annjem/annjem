            <p><a href="https://www.pawsoflarescue.org/" target="_blank">Paws of L.A. Rescue</a> was launching a social media and print campaign to boost volunteer sign-ups, especially for the crucial role of dog fosters. The rescue already had some design concepts, but they wanted a graphic designer to improve upon them while staying within brand guidelines around logo usage, colors, and fonts.</p>

        <p>I liked that the original designs featured the dogs prominently, but I wanted them to stand out even more! I wanted something eye-catching and scroll-stopping, something that makes a viewer stop in their tracks and say “awww”. With that in mind, I placed photos of dogs right up close — so close you could almost pet them — and used light, contrasting colors (orange, blue, and cream) from the brand palette that conveyed happiness and vibrance, and which complemented the colors in the photos.</p>

        <p>I used the brand font <strong>Lato</strong> for the copy, and two handdrawn fonts for the slogan “Foster Love” to add warmth and playfulness. I also set them both on two different paths for an organic hand-lettered feeling.</p>
