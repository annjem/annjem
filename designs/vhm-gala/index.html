        <p>The Vashon Heritage Museum needed a complete visual identity for their annual "Celebrate Our Heritage" fundraising gala, themed around the 1950s. This was a follow-up to the previous year's successful 1920s-themed event, and they had a unique challenge: they wanted to reuse a physical cutout display from last year but needed an entirely new illustration that would work with the existing silhouette. It was like a creative puzzle that combined custom illustration with practical design constraints.</p>

        <h2>Illustration</h2>
        <p>I started by tracing the existing silhouette and thinking about what pose would make sense. The flapper had been mid-dance, so I came up with the idea of a diner waitress balancing her tray while zooming around on rollerskates. It felt authentically 1950s and energetic enough to match the dynamic pose from the previous year.</p>
        <p>Before diving into the illustration, I did a deep dive into 1950s diner research to nail the authentic details. I created the waitress in Procreate using a mid-century illustration style with simple linework, flat shading, and a limited color palette—all hallmarks of that era's graphic design.</p>
        <p>The character details were Rockwell-esque Americana: a swing skirt, polka-dot top, and rollerskates, carrying a tray with an ice cream sundae complete with cherry on top and striped straw, plus a classic glass bottle of soda. Every detail was chosen to immediately transport people back to that nostalgic diner experience.</p>
        <p>For the color palette, I went with classic diner pink as the main color, set against a turquoise diamond background that mimicked the tiled walls and flooring you'd see in vintage diners. The combination felt both authentic and vibrant enough to catch attention across all the promotional materials.</p>

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>The typography was just as important as the illustration. I mixed several fonts inspired by vintage hand-painted signage to capture that authentic 1950s feel without being too literal or cliché. The goal was creating something that felt genuinely retro but still worked for modern applications.</p>
        <p>Across all the deliverables—from 2"x3" name tags to 10-foot banners—I kept the key visual consistent, only cropping or resizing when absolutely necessary. This consistency was crucial for recognition and impact, especially since the materials would be seen in so many different contexts.</p>

        <h2>Collaborative Process</h2>
        <p>Working with Cameron was fantastic. She provided clear, specific direction for the illustration and gave quick, actionable feedback. For example, I originally had the waitress looking surprised, almost spilling her tray, but Cameron asked me to make her confident and smiling instead. That change completely transformed the character's energy and made her so much more appealing and positive.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The final system worked across a wide range of applications: event name tags, social media posts, donation pledge postcards, invitation postcards, EDDM mailers, promotional sandwich boards, promotional banners, and website banners. Each piece maintained the cohesive 1950s aesthetic while serving its specific function.</p>
        <p>The real test was whether the new illustration would work with the existing physical cutout, and it fit perfectly! The museum could reuse their display investment while having a completely fresh look for the new year.</p>
        <p>Cameron was thrilled with how everything turned out, and the proof was in her coming back the following year for another gala illustration and design system. This project really showed me how creative constraints can actually spark better solutions—having to work within that exact silhouette led to an idea I never would have thought of otherwise.</p>
