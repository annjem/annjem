        <p>My conceptual poster design for the wonderful, irreverent, hilarious podcast <a href="https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/" target="_blank">No Such Thing As a Fish</a> that often delves into the weirdest corners of science. I aimed for a whimsical aesthetic, and what better graphic than a colorful vintage illustration?</p>

        <p>For the fonts, I went with the personality-packed <strong>Strange Times</strong> for the title and the delightful handwritten <strong>D.I.Y. Time</strong> for the smaller print. The organic quality of the two make them pair wonderfully well. The URL at the bottom is also set in Strange Times for better readability at small sizes.</p>
